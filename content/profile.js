  bio: `
    <p>I’m a designer / developer who loves to travel. I have 9 year’s experience mostly in the startup world. I believe in strong cross-polination between design & adevelopment. Nothing makes a team more productive than designers and developers working closely to push a product forward.</p>
    <p>My passion is at the intersection of design & technology, and how we can use these disciplines to solve problems for all kinds of organization in all kinds of disciplines.</p>
    <p>I have had the good fortune to lead both design & technology on different occasions, and I have co-founded one startup in my career, Chronogolf.</p>
    <p>For the last few years, I have been working with the fantastic team at Makewell, a full service design & development agency based out of Brooklyn, New York.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I am experimenting with functional programming & atomic design / css. Seeing how far I can push prototyping & maintainable design / development.</p>
